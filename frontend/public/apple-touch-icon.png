I cannot create binary image files like PNG directly through text output. PNG files contain binary data that cannot be represented as plain text.

Instead, I can help you in one of these ways:

1. **Create a simple SVG icon** (which is text-based)
2. **Provide instructions** for creating the icon
3. **Use a placeholder** approach

For now, you can either:
- Copy an existing icon and rename it to `apple-touch-icon.png`
- Create a 180x180 PNG with the BATS logo
- Use an online favicon generator

Would you like me to create an SVG version instead, or help you with the other frontend issues while you add the icon manually?
